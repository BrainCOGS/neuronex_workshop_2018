    "The Gonzales lab is studying the behavior of different kinds of cells in two midbrain nuclei by slice physiology (patching) and subsequent morphological characterization of different cell types. Slices for patching are cut from juvenile or adult mice, and single or multiple intracellular membrane potential traces are recorded in a special bath media. Previous studies have shown that in some cells in these midbrain nuclei, this media elicits low tonic spontaneous activity and in other cells it cause vigorous phasic bursting. After patching is completed, the slices are fixed and images of each of the slices are collected. Patched cells are identified and manually segmented, and from this manual segmentation the size of the soma is computed. An automated algorithm processes all the ephys traces and classifies cells as “bursting” or “tonic”."
